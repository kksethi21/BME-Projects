# Drug Dosage Safety Checker (C++)


## Overview
This project is a C++ program that calculates safe medication dosage ranges based on parameters specific to patient
such as weight and age. The program flags potential overdose or underdose risks, simulating logic used in clinical
decision-making systems.

## Features
- Calculates safe dosage ranges using mg/kg guidelines
- Flags overdose and underdose risks
- Handles invalid inputs and edge cases
- Supports multiple medications
- Clear, clincian-style output

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Assumptions
- Dosage ranges are simplified and for educational purposes only
- Not intended for real clinical use

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Expand drug database
- Integrate file logging or database storage
